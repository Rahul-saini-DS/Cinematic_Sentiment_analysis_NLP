Cinematic Sentiments is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on analyzing movie reviews to determine sentiment. The project leverages Python, machine learning, and statistical methods to preprocess text data and extract features, ultimately optimizing the performance of sentiment classification models.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes tokenization and stop words removal using the NLTK toolkit.
Feature Extraction: Utilizes Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF techniques for advanced feature extraction.
Model Optimization: Employs logistic regression and SVM algorithms, achieving a 20% improvement in model accuracy and a 15% performance boost through optimization.

Achievements
Processed and analyzed 15,000 movie reviews.
Improved sentiment classification model accuracy by 20%.
Achieved a 15% performance boost through the optimization of logistic regression and SVM algorithms.
