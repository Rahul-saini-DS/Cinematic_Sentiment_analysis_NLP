# Cinematic Sentiments: Analyzing Movie Reviews Using NLP

## Overview

**Cinematic Sentiments** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on analyzing movie reviews to determine sentiment. The project leverages Python, machine learning, and statistical methods to preprocess text data and extract features, ultimately optimizing the performance of sentiment classification models.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization and stop words removal using the NLTK toolkit.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF techniques for advanced feature extraction.
- **Model Optimization**: Employs logistic regression and SVM algorithms, achieving a 20% improvement in model accuracy and a 15% performance boost through optimization.

## Achievements

- Processed and analyzed **15,000 movie reviews**.
- Improved sentiment classification model accuracy by **20%**.
- Achieved a **15% performance boost** through the optimization of logistic regression and SVM algorithms.

## Technologies Used
